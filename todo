Log replication:
    ✔ Handle multiple entries append @done(21-07-23 07:11)
    ✔ Change persistence provider - failed, no alternative @done(21-07-23 09:08)
    ✔ Leader forces followers to sync their logs @done(21-07-23 11:26)
    ✔ Log rebuilds properly after failure @done(21-07-24 09:55)
    ✔ Log synces properly after failure @done(21-07-24 09:55)
    ☐ Work out different log testing scenarios and implement them all (paper) @today @critical 
    ☐ Retry append requets call - consider network problems / unavailable clients
    ☐ Which term return from appendEntriesRequest?
    ☐ Error logging, panicking, what to do when persistence fails?

Testing: 
    ✔ Integration Tests running in docker @done(21-07-23 11:29)
    ✔ Probes, tests sometimes fail because of rpc not ready - wait.Http() @done(21-07-24 10:30)
    ✔ Extensive Sql tests @done(21-07-24 09:55)
    ☐ Do I have timing issues or is it alright, coz' I'm still using manual api calls instead of Leader/Follower logic
    ☐ Do test run in paralell and is there better way to do setup/teardown @low 
    

Docker: 
    ☐ go build slow, check out comments from stack
    ☐ store config in .env 
    ☐ make separate docker file for tests

Leader election:
    ☐ After persistence is working properly plan out election
    ☐ Where to set term?
    ☐ Heartbeat
