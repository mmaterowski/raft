Test client:
    ☐ Should be able to put to each server
    ☐ Server should communicate change of leader
    ☐ Server should communicate change to state - display or 3 states and logs
    ☐ Stress test: lots of requests in parallel

Leader election:
    ✔ After persistence is working properly plan out election - read paper to the end @today @done(21-08-03 07:05)
    ✔ Start as a follower @done(21-08-03 08:10)
    ✔ Scenario 1: win election @done(21-08-17 09:24)
        ✔ Election won by single server @done(21-08-03 09:48)
        ✔ Simplify channels, resolve dependencies client / server / etc @done(21-08-16 07:08)
        ✔ Commit entries from log when election won @done(21-08-17 08:50)
    ✔ Scenario 2: another server wins election @done(21-08-17 09:24)
        ✔ Return to follower when heartbeat with higher term received @done(21-08-17 09:24)
    ☐ Scenario 3: nobody wins election
    ✔ Persist VotedFor @done(21-08-17 09:24)

Infrastracture: 
    ☐ Replace API with gin-tonic
    ☐ Endpoints use commands

✔ Log replication: @done(21-08-02 10:16)
    ✔ Handle multiple entries append @done(21-07-23 07:11)
    ✔ Change persistence provider - failed, no alternative @done(21-07-23 09:08)
    ✔ Leader forces followers to sync their logs @done(21-07-23 11:26)
    ✔ Log rebuilds properly after failure @done(21-07-24 09:55)
    ✔ Log synces properly after failure @done(21-07-24 09:55)
    ✔ Work out different log testing scenarios and implement them all (paper) @done(21-08-02 10:07)
    ✔ Retry append requets call - consider network problems / unavailable clients @done(21-08-02 10:07)
    ✔ Which term return from appendEntriesRequest? @done(21-08-02 10:08)
    ✔ Finish implementing log replication @done(21-08-02 10:16)

Testing: 
    ✔ Integration Tests running in docker @done(21-07-23 11:29)
    ✔ Probes, tests sometimes fail because of rpc not ready - wait.Http() @done(21-07-24 10:30)
    ✔ Extensive Sql tests @done(21-07-24 09:55)
    ✔ Do I have timing issues or is it alright, coz' I'm still using manual api calls instead of Leader/Follower logic @done(21-08-02 10:17)
    ☐ Container for unit tests to run in paralell @low 
    ☐ Container for sequential integraiont tests @high 
    ☐ make separate docker file for tests

Docker: 
    ☐ go build slow, check out comments from stack
    ☐ store config in .env
